* people must know what they are signing. Should we serialize the certificate if it has random bits even outside of the signature?
* Where is the public key?
* finish the implementations
* master the rust codes
* Make sure that changing the signature is consistent, otherwise the idea is to fake an inconsistent private key
* Testing?
